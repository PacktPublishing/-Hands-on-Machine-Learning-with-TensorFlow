# Hands-on Machine Learning with TensorFlow [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-on Machine Learning with TensorFlow [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-machine-learning-tensorflow-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789136999), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
With this course you'll learn to take your data analysis and Python programming skills to the next level via Machine Learning using TensorFlow. This course focuses on key Machine Learning techniques and algorithms and you'll apply them practically using TensorFlow models in a hands-on approach. Each section covers a specific Machine Learning task and you will implement it on your system with TensorFlow models. For example, you will learn Logistic Regression and will then implement it with TensorFlow for your analysis tasks. You'll implement techniques such as Classification and Clustering effectively using TensorFlow. Similarly, this course takes you through different ML tasks/algorithms and teaches you to implement them in your applications/systems.
